# MOC-NTE-solver-linear-source

The algorithm is based on the paper https://doi.org/10.13182/NSE15-6. The solvers' geometry sections can be edited to solve other 2D rectangular geometry eigen value or fixed source problems. The python interpreter makes it very slow to solve problems and I hope to convert it to C++ in the future.
